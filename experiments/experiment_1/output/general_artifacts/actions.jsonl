Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.\n        yperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the y\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        yperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        yperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".

Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax.

Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available. Finally, the template string has access\n            to variables `x`, `y`, `z` and `text`.\n        transpose\n            Transposes the z data.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xgap\n            Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the x\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        xperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        xperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".

If \"y\" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If \"y2\", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        ycalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.\n        ygap\n            Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.\n        yhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.\n        yperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the y\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        yperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".

For numbers, see: https://github.com/d\n            3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values\n            are formatted using generic number format.\n        zmax\n            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should\n            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must\n            be set as well.\n        zmid\n            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling\n            `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.\n            Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no\n            effect when `zauto` is `false`.\n        zmin\n            Sets the lower bound of the color domain.
