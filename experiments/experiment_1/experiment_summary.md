# Experiment 1: Gradient Boosting with Feature Engineering

## Experiment Overview

**Objective**: Develop a binary classification model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on banking information and previous marketing campaign interactions.

**Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier with extensive feature engineering
**Primary Metric**: ROC-AUC
**Dataset**: 45,211 instances with 17 features (train/test split)

## Results Summary

### Primary Metrics
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.938 (Excellent discriminative performance)
- **Accuracy**: 90.7%
- **Precision**: 64.0%
- **Recall**: 46.1%
- **F1-Score**: 53.6%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: 71.3%

### Model Performance Analysis

#### Strengths
1. **Excellent Overall Discriminative Power**: ROC-AUC of 0.938 indicates the model is highly effective at distinguishing between subscribers and non-subscribers
2. **High Accuracy**: 90.7% accuracy reflects strong overall performance
3. **Feature Engineering Success**: Engineered features (duration_log, duration-based features) dominate the top importance rankings
4. **Strong Specificity**: 96.6% specificity means the model correctly identifies 96.6% of non-subscribers

#### Limitations
1. **Class Imbalance Impact**: 7.55:1 imbalance ratio (88.3% vs 11.7%) affects minority class performance
2. **Low Recall for Subscribers**: 46.1% recall means the model misses 54% of actual subscribers
3. **Moderate Precision**: 64.0% precision indicates some false positives in subscriber predictions

### Feature Importance Analysis

**Top 5 Most Important Features**:
1. **duration_log** (22.0%): Log-transformed call duration - most predictive feature
2. **duration** (15.2%): Raw call duration
3. **pdays** (8.3%): Days since last contact from previous campaign
4. **poutcome** (8.3%): Outcome of previous marketing campaign
5. **age** (6.4%): Client age

**Key Insights**:
- Duration-related features account for 37.2% of total importance
- Engineered features significantly outperform raw features
- Previous campaign information (pdays, poutcome) is highly predictive
- Demographics (age) and contact timing (day) are moderately important

### Model Configuration
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Hyperparameters**: 200 estimators, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1
- **Features**: 48 total features (after one-hot encoding and feature engineering)
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified CV

### Class Distribution & Performance
- **Class 0 (No subscription)**: 3,993 samples (88.3%)
  - Precision: 93.1%
  - Recall: 96.6%
  - F1-Score: 94.8%
- **Class 1 (Subscription)**: 529 samples (11.7%)
  - Precision: 64.0%
  - Recall: 46.1%
  - F1-Score: 53.6%

## Experiment Planning vs. Results

### Original Hypothesis
The experiment plan hypothesized that:
1. Gradient Boosting would achieve ROC-AUC > 0.93 based on previous experiments
2. Feature engineering would significantly improve model performance
3. Duration, previous campaign outcomes, and demographics would be key predictors

### Results Validation
✅ **ROC-AUC Target Met**: Achieved 0.938, exceeding the >0.93 target
✅ **Feature Engineering Success**: Engineered features dominate importance rankings
✅ **Predictive Features Identified**: Duration, pdays, poutcome, and age are indeed top predictors
⚠️ **Class Imbalance Challenge**: While expected, the impact on recall remains significant

## Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Class Imbalance Handling**
- **Issue**: Low recall (46.1%) for minority class despite high ROC-AUC
- **Impact**: Model misses 54% of potential subscribers, limiting business value
- **Root Cause**: 7.55:1 class imbalance ratio inadequately addressed

### 2. **Precision-Recall Trade-off**
- **Issue**: Moderate precision (64.0%) indicates false positive subscribers
- **Impact**: Resources wasted on non-converting contacts
- **Context**: Default threshold may not be optimal for business objectives

### 3. **Limited Seasonal Feature Engineering**
- **Issue**: Month-based features show modest importance (2-2.5% each)
- **Opportunity**: More sophisticated temporal features could capture seasonal patterns better

## Future Suggestions

### 1. **Advanced Class Imbalance Techniques**
- **Primary Recommendation**: Implement SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or other advanced sampling strategies
- **Rationale**: Current 46.1% recall leaves significant business value on the table
- **Expected Impact**: Improve recall to 60-70% while maintaining reasonable precision

### 2. **Threshold Optimization**
- Conduct systematic threshold tuning using business-driven cost functions
- Balance precision-recall trade-off based on campaign costs vs. conversion value
- Consider different thresholds for different customer segments

### 3. **Ensemble Methods**
- Combine Gradient Boosting with complementary algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks, SVM)
- Use stacking or blending to capture different patterns in the data
